# BombFlip
A clone of Pokemon HG/SS game, Voltorb Flip!

## Game
Bomb Flip can be played [here](https://laurenbarry00.github.io/bombflip/index.html).

## About Bomb Flip
Bomb Flip is a web-based clone of Voltorb Flip, a mini-game from Pokemon HeartGold/SoulSilver.


The gameboard consists of a 5x5 grid of cards. Behind each card is either a 1, 2, 3, or a bomb. The object of the game is to reveal all of the numbered cards to score points without clicking a bomb. To do this, the player is given information on the number of points and bombs in each row and column.

## Future Plans
Planned improvements for Bomb Flip are to refractor the game script to utilize ReactJS or jQuery. Once this is improved, I am also planning on implementing unit tests with Mocha.
